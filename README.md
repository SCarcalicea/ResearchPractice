# ResearchPractice

To run the application you will need a MongoDB installed as well as a Java version greater than 8 and Maven.

ResearchPracticeApplication.init() has 4 loadXXX() methods.
These methods are initializing the DB. 

This will take some time at first load but then you can comment out the lines and then it will start up in 1-2 seconds.

TODO - implement a preload checker.
